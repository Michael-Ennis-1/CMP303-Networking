# Networking
My CMP303 Third Year Networking project. Simple demonstration project of two clients capable of moving in sync over a .NET server, using Interpolation and Prediction techniques, and both transport layer protocols TCP and UDP. 

## Instructions For Use
First, install both the Client and the Server from the download link.
Then, ensure that the Server runs first, before attempting to connect the Client.

## Technical Explanation
This project involves both a server and a client, making use of both TCP and UDP. TCP is used for highly important information that cannot be lost, for example the Client's username. UDP is used to transmit the Client's next movement
